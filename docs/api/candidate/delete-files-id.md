# `DELETE /api/candidate/files/{id}`

## Contract status

`PARTIAL` — a matching OpenAPI operation exists with the same method and path template. Request, response, and error behavior still require source tracing.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `api` | Runtime route inventory |
| `auth:candidateApi` | Runtime route inventory |
| `checkCandidateLockEdit` | Runtime route inventory |
| `detectJobForCandidate` | Runtime route inventory |

Authentication and authorization outcomes are UNVERIFIED beyond the middleware names recorded above.

## Request

### Path parameters

| Runtime parameter | Required | OpenAPI name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | `id` | OpenAPI name matches. |

### Query parameters

The matched OpenAPI operation does not declare query parameters. Runtime query behavior remains UNVERIFIED.

### Headers

UNVERIFIED — header requirements are not represented in the runtime route inventory.

### Body

The matched OpenAPI operation does not declare a request body. Runtime body behavior remains UNVERIFIED.

## Response

### Success and declared responses

| Status | Description | Content types | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `200` | OK | application/json | OpenAPI declaration |

Runtime Resource/DTO mapping is UNVERIFIED.

## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Business flow and side effects

Flow baseline: [SPEC-009](/docs/flows/candidate-lifecycle) — Files.

Detailed transitions, mutations, external calls, and side effects are UNVERIFIED at endpoint-page granularity. Trace the controller/service call chain against the canonical business-flow and database-relationship specifications before relying on this page as a behavior contract.

This page is generated from the runtime route inventory and available OpenAPI reference. It intentionally does not infer undocumented request or response fields.
