# `GET /api/candidate/me/mm_ni_numbers`

> Runtime inventory records the declaration as `GET / HEAD`; this page uses `GET` for OpenAPI comparison.

## Contract status

`CODE_ONLY` — runtime route exists in the route inventory, but no semantically matching operation was found in the current OpenAPI YAML references.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `api` | Runtime route inventory |
| `auth:candidateApi` | Runtime route inventory |
| `checkCandidateLockEdit` | Runtime route inventory |

Authentication and authorization outcomes are UNVERIFIED beyond the middleware names recorded above.

## Request

### Path parameters

No path parameters are identified in the runtime route template.

### Query parameters

UNVERIFIED — query parameters are not represented in the runtime route inventory.

### Headers

UNVERIFIED — header requirements are not represented in the runtime route inventory.

### Body

UNVERIFIED — request body schema is not represented in the runtime route inventory.

## Response

### Success and declared responses

UNVERIFIED — no response contract was found in the available OpenAPI operation.

## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Business flow and side effects

Flow baseline: [SPEC-004](/docs/flows/candidate-lifecycle) — Candidate profile/MM identity.

Detailed transitions, mutations, external calls, and side effects are UNVERIFIED at endpoint-page granularity. Trace the controller/service call chain against the canonical business-flow and database-relationship specifications before relying on this page as a behavior contract.
