# `GET /api/consultant/branches`

> Runtime inventory records the declaration as `GET / HEAD`; this page uses `GET` for OpenAPI comparison.

## Contract status

`PARTIAL` — OpenAPI method/path matches runtime; some runtime details may be incomplete.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware |
|---|
| `api` |
| `auth:userApi` |

If this route is protected, follow the [authentication guide](/docs/authentication) for the required Authorization header and guard.

## Request

### Path parameters

No path parameters are identified in the runtime route template.

### Query parameters

The matched OpenAPI operation does not declare query parameters. Runtime query behavior remains UNVERIFIED.

### Headers

If protected, use the Authorization header from the [authentication guide](/docs/authentication); add route-specific scope headers only when this endpoint requires them.

### Body

The matched OpenAPI operation does not declare a request body. Runtime body behavior remains UNVERIFIED.

## Response

### Success and declared responses

| Status | Description | Content types |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | OK | application/json |


## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Flow

Flow baseline: [SPEC-035](/docs/flows/authentication-and-access) — Authentication/access/lock.
