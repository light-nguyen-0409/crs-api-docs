# `POST /api/compliance/escalated_issues/{id}/assign`

## Contract status

`PARTIAL` — a matching OpenAPI operation exists with the same method and path template. Request, response, and error behavior still require source tracing.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `api` | Runtime route inventory |
| `auth:userApi` | Runtime route inventory |
| `detectBranchForCompliance` | Runtime route inventory |

For protected routes, send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` from the matching candidateApi or userApi login flow. See the [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication) for token handling and scope headers.

## Request

### Path parameters

| Runtime parameter | Required | OpenAPI name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | `id` | OpenAPI name matches. |

### Query parameters

The matched OpenAPI operation does not declare query parameters. Runtime query behavior remains UNVERIFIED.

### Headers

For protected routes, send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`; add `Gap-Branch-ID` or `Gap-Job-ID` only when the route middleware requires it.

### Body

| Required | Content types | Description |
|---|---|---|
| No | application/json | OpenAPI requestBody |

## Response

### Success and declared responses

| Status | Description | Content types | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `200` | OK | application/json | OpenAPI declaration |

Runtime Resource/DTO mapping is UNVERIFIED.

## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Business flow and side effects

Flow baseline: [SPEC-016](/docs/flows/staff-review-and-support) — Escalated issue.

Detailed transitions, mutations, external calls, and side effects are UNVERIFIED at endpoint-page granularity. Trace the controller/service call chain against the canonical business-flow and database-relationship specifications before relying on this page as a behavior contract.

## Source and verification notes

| Source | Value |
