# `GET /api/compliance/jobs`

> Runtime inventory records the declaration as `GET / HEAD`; this page uses `GET` for OpenAPI comparison.

## Contract status

`CODE_ONLY` — runtime route has no matching OpenAPI operation.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware |
|---|
| `api` |
| `auth:userApi` |
| `detectBranchForCompliance` |

If this route is protected, follow the [authentication guide](/docs/authentication) for the required Authorization header and guard.

## Request

### Path parameters

No path parameters are identified in the runtime route template.

### Query parameters

UNVERIFIED — query parameters are not represented in the runtime route inventory.

### Headers

If protected, use the Authorization header from the [authentication guide](/docs/authentication); add route-specific scope headers only when this endpoint requires them.

### Body

UNVERIFIED — request body schema is not represented in the runtime route inventory.

## Response

### Success and declared responses

UNVERIFIED — no response contract was found in the available OpenAPI operation.

## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Flow

Flow baseline: [SPEC-007](/docs/flows/candidate-lifecycle) — Candidate/job application.
