# `DELETE /api/compliance/candidates/{id}`

## Contract status

`CODE_ONLY` — runtime route exists in the route inventory, but no semantically matching operation was found in the current OpenAPI YAML references.

## Authentication and middleware

| Middleware | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `api` | Runtime route inventory |
| `auth:userApi` | Runtime route inventory |
| `detectBranchForCompliance` | Runtime route inventory |

For protected routes, send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` from the matching candidateApi or userApi login flow. See the [Authentication guide](/docs/authentication) for token handling and scope headers.

## Request

### Path parameters

| Runtime parameter | Required | OpenAPI name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | UNVERIFIED | UNVERIFIED | OpenAPI declaration is UNVERIFIED. |

### Query parameters

UNVERIFIED — query parameters are not represented in the runtime route inventory.

### Headers

For protected routes, send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`; add `Gap-Branch-ID` or `Gap-Job-ID` only when the route middleware requires it.

### Body

UNVERIFIED — request body schema is not represented in the runtime route inventory.

## Response

### Success and declared responses

UNVERIFIED — no response contract was found in the available OpenAPI operation.

## Errors

UNVERIFIED — controller, validation, authentication, and exception mappings require source tracing.

## Business flow and side effects

Flow baseline: [SPEC-017](/docs/flows/staff-review-and-support) — Compliance approval.

Detailed transitions, mutations, external calls, and side effects are UNVERIFIED at endpoint-page granularity. Trace the controller/service call chain against the canonical business-flow and database-relationship specifications before relying on this page as a behavior contract.
